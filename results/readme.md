### Results

Here, we store in raw format the core results of our experiments, both those reported in the paper and extra ones.

The raw format is stored only for core experiments of this benchmark (to save space), for others we report only metrics.

The code to reproduce the figures and tables reported in the [paper](link_to_arxiv) is in `xx.ipynb`
